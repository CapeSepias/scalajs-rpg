# __Summary__

1. Know scala, have to deal with front end
2. Don't scalajs, we will show you how
3. Do scalajs, here's our opinions

^ dave

# __Who are we?__

* Server Side scala/akka developers
* NOT scalajs experts 
* Web app scala developers writing javascript for the front-end 

^ katrin

# __Who are you?__

* Server Side scala/akka  developers
* You gotta write a frontend, its gotta be all that. 
* Web app scala developer writing javascript

^ katrin

# __As an aside maybe talk about scalatags -> scalarx -> scalajs__

scalatags for wrangling html on the server is gateway drug to scalajs ecosystem

^ dave

---

# __Why would I ever?__

story about dave + katrin: amoung all the possible front-end frameworks
to learn, why would I choose scalajs?

This a good question

^ katrin dave

Manager: "why not just use/learn what already exists"

Andre " Just learn javascript already, its not that f@#$ hard"

You need a "setup" to get going...

(* setup =  at least some tooling, framework, dependency mgmt etc.)

# __Javascript__

There are mature best practices for js, many frameworks, all good, all necessary to be effective front end dev.

eg. javascript inheritance might be something you would need to understand, you might have to read "javascript the good parts"

There are many javascript gotchas you need to know about.

You are already a scala expert and familiar with SBT, you already have 2/3 of your  "setup".

Now you have your complete setup, whats next?

(Be a "Full stack / Cross Functional developer")

Show your manager this shit works.

Find an internal project that requires a meaningful front-end

Has to be something your people care about. 

Expose meaningful work that is could benefit from an interactive visual representation..

eg. analytics, devops etc.

^ dave

how exactly to interact with existing libs, js.native is EASY

make use of existing javascript goodies eg. d3
